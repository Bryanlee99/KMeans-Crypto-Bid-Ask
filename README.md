# KMeans-Crypto-Bid-Ask
The project implements KMeans in Python to categorize characteristic cryptocurrency bid-ask graphs. The motivation is to identify trends in the graphs which may be correlated with price increases and decreases. 

Analysis focuses on the bid-ask spread, shifts in the bid and ask graphs, and the slope of the bid and ask graphs.
